<!-- CSS - Inline

Inline CSS is basically doing CSS within the HTML element
so if you remember we were doing

<p>Hello</p> to say make a new paragraph with the body "Hello"?

Now lets say we want to style it a bit, so to do that we do:

<p style="font-style: italic;">Hello</p>

This will set the font-style of the "Hello" to italic, and thats how simple it is!

The downside to this is that it only affects a SINGLE element.

-->

<p style="font-style: italic;">Hello</p>

<!--

To change something like the boldness, we need to alter font-weight instead
of font-style. Because the bold characteristic comes weight rather than
style.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">HackDays!</p>
