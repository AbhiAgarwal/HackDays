<!-- CSS - Internal

Internal CSS is basically putting the CSS inside the HTML file
but putting it under the <style> </style> tag in the header.

This is if you want to have a specific type of CSS for a 
SINGLE page.

<style>
p {
	color: green;
	font-size: 100;
}
</style>

<p>OMG GREEN!</p>
<h2>Not green :(</h2>

<!-- 

Run it and get shocked and surprised. This is going to be green!
But the h1 won't be green! WOW.
