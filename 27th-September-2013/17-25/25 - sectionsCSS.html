<!--

You can also do specific things to specific sections in CSS. For example if you want to underline all the texts with a hyperlink or <a> tags, then you can do this:

section a{
	color: blue;
	text-decoration: underline;
}

-->

<style>

section a{
	color: blue;
	text-decoration: underline;
}


/*
So here we've put <a> into a specific section. This will allow you to divide sections, and everything that is in a particular section or in a section will follow these values. 
*/

</style>

<section>
	<a href="http://www.nyusw.com">Section A</a>
