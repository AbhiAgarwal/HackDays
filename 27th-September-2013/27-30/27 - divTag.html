<!-- Divider Tags! 

Important to learn how to divide things in HTML.

Div Tags allow individuals to seperate content from eachother. 
They are easily customizable using CSS & HTML, and they are the
tags that usually divide pages into different sections. 

Here is a basic example of a DIV tag.

-->

<style>
#tech {
	background: aqua;
}

#tech h1 {
	font-family: 'Clicker Script', cursive;
}

#tech h2 {
	font-family: 'Clicker Script', cursive;
}
</style>

<div id="tech">
	<h1>Tech@NYU</h1>
	<h2>HackDays!</h2>
</div>

<div>
	<p>Hello guys :)</p>
</div>

<!--

It gives it a background at a certain position, and seperates content from eachother
Then you can do more things like put DIVS into sections, and group many divs into one section

-->

<section>
	<div>
		<h1>Startup Week is coming</h1>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h1>Damn Sections are together</h1>
	</div>
</section>
