<!--
We can get something called an ID to each element. It works in the same way as class Selectors, but they have more authority than class Selectors. If you want to change a particular part of something very specific IDs are your friends!

<h2 class="hello" id="hello232">Hello!</h2>

We'll use Internal CSS for this one, to make it easier!
-->

<style>

.hello {
	color: blue;
	font-size: 50px;
}

#hello232 { /* Just to show its unique */
	color: purple;
	font-size: 250px;
}

/*
For IDS the syntax usually is:

#className {
	property: value;
}

Everything is the same but you've to use the HASH infront of the className.
*/

</style>

<h2 class="hello" id="hello232">Hello!</h2>

<h2 class="hello">same class but not same ID</h2>
