<!-- CSS - External!

External CSS is when you are able to link a CSS file to your web page!
CSS files are basically .css, and are saved and used to load web pages.

They're primarily used to design web pages and get properties of elements
that you want to be different colors.

-->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="5 - CSS.css">

<p>WOW</p>

<!-- 

Run this and see! The WOW will be orange!
It's because its getting the properties from the .css file! 
It's an amazing way of centralizing and using the same CSS content
for all your different web pages!
