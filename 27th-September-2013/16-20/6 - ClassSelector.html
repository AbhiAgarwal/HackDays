<!--
There's something called class Selectors, which are able to set a particular style to all elements that have that class. Lets see an example

<h2 class="hello">Hello!</h2>

We'll use Internal CSS for this one, to make it easier!
-->

<style>
.hello {
	color: blue;
	font-size: 50px;
}

/*
For classes the syntax usually is:

.className {
	property: value;
}

Everything is the same but you've to use the DOT infront of the className.
*/

</style>


<h2 class="hello">Hello!</h2>

<h2 class="notHello">not Class HELLO</h2>
