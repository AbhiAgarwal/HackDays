<!-- Sometimes you might have a problem where your "&" sign or other signs don't print properly. You'll need to use the HTML ASCII reference chart. -->
<!-- You can just replace it with &amp; and it'll work! Sublime will even tell you that it won't work by highlighting it. -->
<!-- We can see that even though the Euro Sign doesn't work when we use the &euro; ASCII key it does work. -->

<!-- As a reference: "http://www.ascii.cl/htmlcodes.htm" is great -->
<!-- ASCII is: American Standard Code for Information Interchange, look it up later! -->
