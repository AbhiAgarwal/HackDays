HackDays
========

Summary of the events that go on at Tech@NYU's HackDays. 

HackDays is a meetup based on the philosophies that:

- You're a lot more productive when there's a time limit,
- When learning to code, the fastest way to learn is to make something,
- The best way to be introduced to new programming concepts is by interacting with other hackers,
- You don't have to be a code ninja - a lot of HackDays participants are brand new to programming. There are plenty of experienced CS students and hackers around to help.
- If you're a current college student (CS or otherwise) and want to hang out and hack with others - come to Hackdays!
- If you're attending a Hackday:
    - Bring a laptop to follow along.
    - Talks always start at 5:30pm.
    - Ask a lot of questions.
