<!-- CSS - Cascading Style Sheets

What we do in CSS is

There's something called a selector, so the name of the element,
lets say it is p,
and you want to set its property, color to black.

In CSS this is basically how you would do it.

p { 
color: black; 
}

This code will basically set all <p> elements to have the color black. 
The curly braces are important as they are used to CONTAIN the data
inside them.
