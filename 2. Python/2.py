# What is #??
# '#' is just a way to put comments into the Python File
# 
# '#' Allows you to comment your program and for your personal notes or
# notes regarding the meaning of the program

print "Hello World" # sjiodjasiojdasiodjasio
#
#	
print "Hello?" # I'm printing out hello here

# # # #

# You just put # anywhere you want in the program, but don't put it in between
# functions like:
# print # "Hello" THIS WOULD NOT work
# print "Hello" # THIS would work

print "Hello" # This comment will work even after you say "Hello"
# You can see that this doesn't stop the program from working
print "See?"
print # what?? "Print" see it didn't work!

print 'Isn\'t'

# To print you can also do
print 'WOW even one works!!!!!'
print 'Isn\'t Python kinda cool?'

How did you just have that ' inside the '' ??
You've to use something called a line break
It basically tells the machine you're going to use it in the sentence
and not to stop the sentence
'''
# If you want to quote on many lines you can also do:

'''
helaodjsaiojdaiosjdosaj

Hey look I'm Commenting here! This is basically a string input like we showed before!
But we're not saying "print" before it so the computer just won't do anything with it!
It's really convinient - try put a print before the three single quotes at the beginning!
