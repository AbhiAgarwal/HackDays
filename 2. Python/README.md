Python Libraries
=====

You walk into a library, and this library is made of millions of books. For every few books there is something called a section. Each section gives you access to particular knowledge where you can solve one particular problem using the books that are in here. 

This plays the same way in Python. In the world of Python there are millions of libraries (a.k.a our physical libraries), and each library has sections (or the functions that are in that library), and each function performs a certain task or solves a issue you're having (or gives you access to new knowledge). It works the same way.

Library -> Sections -> Each section has many functions -> Each function solves a problem.

Example:

Library called math -> The library has a section called "Powers and Logarithmic Functions" -> In that section is a function called "exp" -> The function takes a number, and evaluates it: e^x and gives it back to you.

This would be like going into the math section of a physical library, finding the "Powers and Logarithmic" book, and finding the equation that solves the exponent problem: especially the e^x problem.
