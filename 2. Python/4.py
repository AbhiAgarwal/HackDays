# Conditional Statements

# A conditional statement is a statement that allows you to check for conditions
# you defined on variables.

# For example, I have a variable with a number, and I want to test if the number is
# Greater than 5. What do I do?

variable = 5

if variable > 5:
	print "Number is greater than 5!!"
