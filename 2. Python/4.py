# Conditional Statements

# A conditional statement is a statement that allows you to check 
# for conditions on data.
# The resulting outcome is dependent on the statement after the "if":
# "if" is true or false
# so
# if abhis_age > 16:
# 	he can drive
# else:
# 	he cannot drive
# We mainly concentrate on the statement "abhis_age > 16"
# where abhis_age is a variable defined

# For example, I have a variable with a number, and I want to test if the number is
# Greater than 5. What do I do?

variable = 5

if variable > 5:
	print "Number is greater than 5!!"
else:
	print "Number is NOT greater than 5"
