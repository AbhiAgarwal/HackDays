# Welcome to Python!

# Python will allow you to build applications, manipulate data,
# and perform calculations & operations.

# First lets print things!
print "Hello World!"
print "This is awesome!!!"
print "Isn't this easy"

# How to run Python you ask?
# You go on the "Terminal" on the Mac OSX
# or Windows Powershell on Windows

# Then you do: "python hello.py" on the Powershell or OSX
